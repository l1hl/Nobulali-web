                                My career journey started on stage and writing for the stage, later joining film
                                and television. My break-out role was playing ‘Lulu’ in Sophiatown, directed by
                                Malcolm Purkey at The Market Theatre. This role earned me a Naledi Award for
                                Best Newcomer. Since then, I have had the privilege of presenting two youth
                                television shows, Take 5 and Iketsetse. I then played the role of ‘Thuliswe’ in the
                                SABC 3 drama series Hard Copy III, ‘Yoli’ in the second and third seasons of the
                                SABC 1 drama series Home Affairs, and ‘Thuli’ in the SABC 1 mini-series A Place
                                Called Home.

                                I also played the role of a drug dealer's daughter ‘Nkhensani Tshinawa’ in the
                                e.tv soapie, Rhythm City, and the role of ‘Cynthia’ in a movie called The Bet,
                                directed by Hlomla Dandala for Curious Pictures. As an actor, I have also
                                dabbled in television commercials for MTN and LoveLife, and I have a plethora
                                of voice overs for radio PSAs under my belt. The stage is a special place, and
                                one where I feel quite at home.
